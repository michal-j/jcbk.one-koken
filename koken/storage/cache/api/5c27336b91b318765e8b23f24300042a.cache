{"id":9,"title":"Analog adventure","draft_title":"Analog adventure amok","slug":"analog-adventure","featured":false,"featured_order":null,"content":"","draft":"<p class=\"\">It was probably already more than a year ago that shooting a roll of an actual film crossed my mind. The retro fad affected pretty much everything around and I'd lied if I said it didn't affect me at all (though I'd like to believe that the actual impact it had on me was tiny and insignificant since I always <mark>fancied myself as<\/mark> a person that goes against the tide rather than with it ;)). Digital photography is nice and safe but I wanted to challenge myself and get out of my comfort zone to feel the thrill of the photography the 'olden days' \u2013 fully manual, without instant feedback and with limited \"storage\".<\/p><p class=\"\">This was easy to achieve \u2013 my father had a Zenit TTL coupled with a 58mm f2 Helios lens (the one I've actually used with my Pentax for quite some time) \u2013 a combo he acquired some time during the 70s and which he used to take hundreds of photos in the subsequent decades. I had a great deal of respect for that camera as most of my family photos were shot with it and in rare circumstances that my dad allowed me to shoot it as a kid, it proved virtually impossible to operate. For the past 10\u201315 years, however, it was collecting dust in my dad's apartment so it was high time to revitalize it.<\/p><p class=\"\">Finding unexpired film to shoot on also proved easier than I imagined. I've found a lab that sells a number of different Fujifilm films (and some other brands, too) so I picked up a Superia 200 and was ready to go. I will spare you the detailed desciption of <b>what<\/b> I was photographing \u2013 the primary objective was to get a good feel for the camera, experiment a little and mostly have fun, so the photos were not meant to be spectacular, but I do want to touch upon the subject of <b>how<\/b> the process went on from the technical viewpoint \u2013 especially now that I have the developed film in my hands.<\/p><p class=\"\">As I'm a fan of lists, let's make this a list summarizing my experience:<\/p><ol><li><b>Inserting the film into the camera<\/b> \u2013 fortunately, my father did it for me as I would have probably screwed it big time. But I'll do the next roll myself.<\/li><li><b><mark>Winding the film<\/mark><\/b> \u2013 since I hadn't shot an SLR before, the concept of winding the film before\/after every single shot was largely unfamiliar to me; obviously it wasn't a problem but it slowed me down every time as I was so used to shoot digitally.<\/li><li><b>Exposure counter dial<\/b> \u2013 my god, is this the stupidest thing ever! If you happen to not know what it is, it's that dial on the top plate telling you how many shots you've taken. The idea is perfectly fine, if not for the fact that it moves so lightly that you can screw up your counter just by touching the dial. I did it at least a couple of times just taking it out of the bag so I never had any idea exactly how many photos I'd taken.<\/li><li><b>Viewfinder<\/b> \u2013 definitely the biggest quirk I've had for this camera and for a number of reasons:<\/li><span style=\"background\u2013color: transparent;\"><ul><li>Its front element is so small that you can't see the entire frame \u2013 you need to move your eye around to see the borders.<\/li><li>While on faster apertures it's not so bad to look through, when you stop down to see pretty much next to nothing. Really. I get that the aperture blades actually close down in real time when you use the aperture ring but at the same time it makes it impossible to compose and\/or focus on apertures of about f5.6 and slower, especially indoors. You need to do that on f2 and then stop down without moving the camera. But you're screwed either way because the exposure indicator also becomes invisible so what you're left with is an educated guess.<\/li><li>The viewfinder doesn't cover the entire scene. And by quite a large margin, looking at the developed photos. My dad warned me about it (he still has this nasty habit of cutting the top of people's heads when shooting with my Pentax) but it's really difficult to realistically assess how much the camera actually covers without using it for a prolonged period of time.<\/li><li>Focusing \u2013 it's a bitch. And I didn't realize how much until I saw the developed photos. I obviously thought I nailed it every single time but ... well, not even close. It's something that baffles me because I've shot with the Helios on my Pentax, and the Pentax offers no aid whatsoever while focusing manually (unlike Zenit) but my photos taken with the Helios attached to the Pentax never looked so out of focus. I know that I was shooting mainly wide open on the Zenit (for reasons stated above) and I'm also aware that the Zenit is a 35mm camera and the Pentax has an APS\u2013C sensor, but still... (I need to make a confession at this point \u2013 I've taken another look at the photos and they're not so bad in terms of focus.)<\/li><\/ul><\/span><li><b>Extracting the film from the camera<\/b> \u2013 boy, oh boy... I'd never done this before and this time my father wasn't around to help me with it, so I did what most people would've probably done in my situation \u2013 I consulted the one and only source of all information, the highest oracle \u2013 THE INTERNET. And THE INTERNET forgot to tell me that there was a little thing right beneath the shutter that I was supposed to push down when rolling the film. Since I didn't, the film didn't want to just civilly roll back to the container by itself, and so I had to use force on him. So much, that I tore it (as I later found out) but I didn't know that at the moment. However, I became suspicious after a longer period of unsuccessful winding of the crank so I opened up the camera to see if I'm making any progress \u2013 not only did I find the film still loaded as it must have been before, but I also realized that I exposed it and probably ruined it...<\/li><\/ol><p class=\"\">I took the camera to the lab to seek help. Fortunately, they were able to extract the film in an unscathed form but the real question was whether it was entirely exposed or not. I had to wait for a day for the lab to develop the film, so in the meantime, once again, I decided to consult THE INTERNET so see if it has any information on the possible condition of my precious photographs. I found a Yahoo thread with an issue similar to mine in which almost everybody condemned that poor guy's film to hell. It didn't make me optimistic but it turned out my concern was premature as most frames came out OK (but I did lose most photos taken with my girlfriend which I was really waiting for).<\/p><p class=\"\"><b>PHOTO OF PHOTOS<\/b><\/p><p class=\"\">This pretty much sums up my experience of shooting analog for the first time (okay, not really the first time as I shot film on some compact cameras waaay back but it was the first time using an SLR, and using it <b>consciously<\/b>). I realize I've mostly described the negative and\/or problematic side of things so to counter that I need to say this \u2013 I had a blast. Shooting film was extremely fun and in a strange way liberating. It's a very satisfying experience. Like a said at the very beginning of this post \u2013 it's a thrill, it adds the unknown back the entire process. I wish the Zenit was easier to operate but it also adds to the challenge which in itself is something worth giving a try. And this camera turns you into a sexy looking retro nerd when it's hanging down your neck ;)<\/p><p class=\"\"><b>PHOTO OF ME WITH ZENIT<\/b><\/p><p class=\"\">Will I try this again even though the end product was in my opinion largely underwhelming? Absolutely. I already picked up a new roll of film when I went to get the pictures. And this time it's going to be even more fun ;)<\/p><p class=\"\"><b>PHOTO OF ILFORD<\/b><\/p>","excerpt":"","published":false,"page_type":"essay","published_on":{"datetime":"2016\/05\/28 22:33:18","timestamp":1464474798,"utc":true},"created_on":{"datetime":"2016\/05\/24 19:36:52","timestamp":1464118612,"utc":true},"modified_on":{"datetime":"2016\/05\/28 22:33:18","timestamp":1464474798,"utc":true},"internal_id":"eb6cb2c7b163caae06beeb1d05a0b5c5","__koken__":"essay","tags":[],"categories":{"count":0,"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/api.php?\/text\/9\/categories"},"topics":{"count":0,"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/api.php?\/text\/9\/topics"},"featured_image":{"__koken__":"content","custom":true,"filename":"IMGP1424.jpg","filesize":234094,"width":800,"height":531,"aspect_ratio":1.507,"cache_path":{"prefix":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/","extension":"1464474795.jpg"},"presets":{"tiny":{"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/tiny.1464474795.jpg","hidpi_url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/tiny.2x.1464474795.jpg","width":60,"height":40,"cropped":{"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/tiny.crop.1464474795.jpg","hidpi_url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/tiny.crop.2x.1464474795.jpg","width":60,"height":60}},"small":{"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/small.1464474795.jpg","hidpi_url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/small.2x.1464474795.jpg","width":100,"height":66,"cropped":{"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/small.crop.1464474795.jpg","hidpi_url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/small.crop.2x.1464474795.jpg","width":100,"height":100}},"medium":{"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/medium.1464474795.jpg","hidpi_url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/medium.2x.1464474795.jpg","width":480,"height":319,"cropped":{"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/medium.crop.1464474795.jpg","hidpi_url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/medium.crop.2x.1464474795.jpg","width":480,"height":480}},"medium_large":{"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/medium_large.1464474795.jpg","hidpi_url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/medium_large.2x.1464474795.jpg","width":800,"height":531,"cropped":{"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/medium_large.crop.1464474795.jpg","hidpi_url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/medium_large.crop.2x.1464474795.jpg","width":531,"height":531}},"large":{"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/large.1464474795.jpg","hidpi_url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/large.2x.1464474795.jpg","width":800,"height":531,"cropped":{"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/large.crop.1464474795.jpg","hidpi_url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/large.crop.2x.1464474795.jpg","width":531,"height":531}},"xlarge":{"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/xlarge.1464474795.jpg","hidpi_url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/xlarge.2x.1464474795.jpg","width":800,"height":531,"cropped":{"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/xlarge.crop.1464474795.jpg","hidpi_url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/xlarge.crop.2x.1464474795.jpg","width":531,"height":531}},"huge":{"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/huge.1464474795.jpg","hidpi_url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/huge.2x.1464474795.jpg","width":800,"height":531,"cropped":{"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/huge.crop.1464474795.jpg","hidpi_url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/koken\/storage\/cache\/images\/custom\/IMGP1424-jpg\/huge.crop.2x.1464474795.jpg","width":531,"height":531}}}},"read_more":false,"date":{"datetime":"2016\/05\/28 22:33:18","timestamp":1464474798,"utc":true},"url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/blog\/2016\/05\/analog-adventure\/","__koken_url":"\/blog\/2016\/05\/analog-adventure\/","canonical_url":"http:\/\/jcbk.one\/blog\/2016\/05\/analog-adventure\/"}
