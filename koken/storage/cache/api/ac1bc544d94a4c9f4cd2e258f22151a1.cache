The idea is simple - each day for the next 365 days I am to take a photo and share it on Instagram. In order to keep the entire thing in order, I've created some rules by which I need to comply:<\/p><p class=\"\">1. All the photographs must be taken with my phone and all the edits must be done on my phone as well.<\/p><p class=\"\">2. Each photograph taken on a given day must also be edited and shared on Instagram on that same day, ie. between 00:00 and 23:59 (12AM and 11:59PM). Photographs taken on any other day cannot be used.<\/p><p class=\"\">3. There is no restriction on the subject of the photographs but it best be visually engaging and not be forced or thoughtless.<\/p><p class=\"\">4. Documenting reality is not a primary goal. More important is the visual aspect of the photographs so all forms of color-, exposure-, and effect-based post processing are acceptable (along with cropping, rotating and adjusting perspective) but doctoring is not.<\/p><br><p class=\"\"><b>What I hope to achieve with this project:<\/b><\/p><p class=\"\">1. Motivate myself to take more photos and take them more regularly.<\/p><p class=\"\">2. Push myself to look for photo opportunites and enhance my creative thinking.<\/p><p class=\"\">3. Better my technical skills.<\/p><p class=\"\">4. Establish a larger portfolio.<\/p><p class=\"\">5. Build an audience for my photography.<\/p><br><p class=\"\">See you in 365 days!<\/p><br><p class=\"\"><b>EDIT:<\/b> Oh, and I almost forgot about this:<\/p><p class=\"\">6. Have fun ;)<\/p>","excerpt":"Two days ago, I've decided to start a #365days photography project. The idea is simple - each day for the next 365 days I am to take a photo and share it on Instagram.
