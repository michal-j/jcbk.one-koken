The idea is simple - each day for the next 365 days I am to take a photo and share it on Instagram. In order to keep the entire thing in order, I've created some rules by which I need to comply:<\/p><p class=\"\">1. All the photographs must be taken with my phone and all the edits must be done on my phone as well.<\/p><p class=\"\">2. Each photograph taken on a given day must also be edited and shared on Instagram on that same day, ie. between 00:00 and 23:59 (12AM and 11:59PM). Photographs taken on any other day cannot be used.<\/p><p class=\"\">3. There is no restriction on the subject of the photographs but it best be visually engaging and not be forced or thoughtless.<\/p><p class=\"\">4. Documenting reality is not a primary goal. More important is the visual aspect of the photographs so all forms of color-, exposure-, and effect-based post processing are acceptable (along with cropping, rotating and adjusting perspective) but doctoring is not.<\/p><br><p class=\"\"><b>What I hope to achieve with this project:<\/b><\/p><p class=\"\">1. Motivate myself to take more photos and take them more regularly.<\/p><p class=\"\">2. Push myself to look for photo opportunites and enhance my creative thinking.<\/p><p class=\"\">3.

That video was of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.birdsasart.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Arhur Morris<\/a> presenting his bird photography gear for the CanonUSA Youtube Channel:<\/p><p class=\"\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/PA6UqIYh-OA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"\nalign: center;\"><\/iframe><br><\/p><p class=\"\">There was a part which I found particularly interesting, and which begins at 8:24 of the video:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>Not a day goes by when I don't realize how blessed I am to live in this time of technology with incredible autofocus cameras, great sharp telephoto lenses. <strong>But everybody needs to remember that the cameras and the lenses do not make the pictures<\/strong>. It's the photographer, the person behind the lens.<\/blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"\">Now, this carries an important piece of information and a generally accepted truth \u2013 that <b>the photographer is the single most important factor responsible for taking a photograph<\/b> \u2013 but at the same time it preserves a common misconception and is also hard to take seriously as the author of those words has just shown us his equipment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. That poses a question \u2013 if your equipment doesn't make the pictures, then why own several different lenses coupled with multiple bodies, everything top of the line and extremely expensive, rather than a mediocre DSLR with a kit lens, or even a cheap compact camera? If this expensive gear truly doesn't matter, then why most photographers own it (or perhaps would like to own it but can't afford it<span style=\"font-size: 1em; background-color: initial;\">) rather than, for instance, use the money to travel and thus make an opportunity to take stunning photos?<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\">The answer is obvious but for some reason isn't repeated as often \u2013 it is because the phrase <i>'Your equipment doesn't matter'<\/i> is simply not true. Or rather, <b>it's not true as a universal truth<\/b> \u2013 there are contexts in which it doesn't matter as much as the \"photographer's eye\", but there are also contexts in which it matters a lot. Generally speaking, the person behind the camera is always more important than the equipment being used but saying that the latter doesn't matter at all is <b>misleading and counterfactual<\/b>.<\/p><p class=\"\">Because your gear does matter. Want your pictures to have shallow depth of field? Go for a full frame (or even a medium or large format) and a fast lens. Want to photograph a sporting event? Better equip a fast-focusing body with good tracking, and a lens that won't slow you down. Want to snap candid pictures of a polar bear without putting yourself in harm's way? Prepare your ultra telephoto and a bunch of teleconverters. Unfortunately, all this costs respectable money. But I think everyone knows this well.<\/p><p class=\"\">To put it simply \u2013 what's in your bag does not take amazing photos for you; instead, it helps <i>you<\/i> take them. And the more you spend, the greater the help. So your equipment <i>does <\/i>matter. But your eye, skills and creativity matter <i>a hell lotta more<\/i>.<\/p>","excerpt":"Some time ago I came across a video which made me ponder about a catchphrase often used by photographers.
