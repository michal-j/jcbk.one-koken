If it doesn't make the pictures, then why own several different lenses coupled with multiple bodies, everything top of the line and extremely expensive, rather than a mediocre DSLR with a kit lens, or even a cheap compact camera?<\/p><p class=\"\">It is because the phrase <i>Your equipment doesn't matter<\/i> is simply not true. Or rather, <b>it's not true as a universal truth<\/b> \u2013 there are contexts in which it doesn't matter as much as the \"photographer's eye\", but there are also contexts in which it matters a hell lot. Generally speaking, the person behind the camera is always more important than the equipment being used but saying that the latter doesn't matter at all is <b>misleading and counterfactual<\/b>.<\/p>","excerpt":"Some time ago I came across a video which I which made me ponder about a catchphrase often used by photographers.
