It's the photographer, the person behind the lens.<\/blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"\">Now, this carries an important piece of information and a generally accepted truth \u2013 that <b>the photographer is the single most important factor responsible for taking a photograph<\/b> \u2013 but at the same time it preserves a common misconception and is also hard to take seriously since the author of those words has just shown us his equipment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. That poses a question \u2013 if your equipment doesn't make the pictures, then why own several different lenses coupled with multiple bodies, everything top of the line and extremely expensive, rather than a mediocre DSLR with a kit lens, or even a cheap compact camera? If this expensive gear truly doesn't matter, then why most photographers own it (or perhaps would like to own it but can't afford it<span style=\"font-size: 1em; background-color: initial;\">) rather than, e.g. use the money to travel and thus make an opportunity to take stunning photos?<\/span><\/p><p class=\"\">The answer is obvious and known to all but for some reason isn't repeated as often; it is because the phrase <i>'Your equipment doesn't matter'<\/i> is simply not true. Or rather, <b>it's not true as a universal truth<\/b> \u2013 there are contexts in which it doesn't matter as much as the \"photographer's eye\", but there are also contexts in which it matters a hell lot. Generally speaking, the person behind the camera is always more important than the equipment being used but saying that the latter doesn't matter at all is <b>misleading and counterfactual<\/b>.<\/p><p class=\"\">- You like that blurry background effect that you can often see in professional photographs? You can achieve that (or at least try to) with pretty much any camera you own but a very fast lens, or a telephoto lens, or a full-frame\/medium format camera (or \u2013 best case scenario \u2013 all three put together) would help a ton and magnify that effect greatly. Let's be honest \u2013 you can blur your background on a cheap APS-C DSLR with a kit lens (or even on a smartphone camera) but you can <i>never<\/i> achieve the same results as photographers who have the above combo.<\/p><p class=\"\">You equipment <i>does <\/i>matter but your eye, vision and creativity matter <i>a hell lotta more<\/i>.<\/p>","excerpt":"Some time ago I came across a video which I which made me ponder about a catchphrase often used by photographers.
