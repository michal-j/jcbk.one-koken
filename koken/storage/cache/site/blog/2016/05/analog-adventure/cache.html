</h1>
<p class="">Perhaps over a year ago the idea of shooting a roll of an actual film crossed my mind. The retro fad has affected pretty much everything around – music, fashion, film, as well as photography – and I would have lied if I said it didn't affect me at all (though I'd like to believe that the actual impact it had on me was tiny and insignificant since I always fancied myself as a person that goes against the tide rather than with it). Digital photography is pleasant and safe but I wanted to challenge myself and get out of my comfort zone to feel the thrill of the photography the 'olden days' – fully manual, without instant feedback and with limited "storage".</p><p class="">This was easy to achieve in my case; my father had a Zenit TTL coupled with a 58mm f2 Helios lens (the one I've actually used with my Pentax for quite some time) – a combo he acquired some time during the 70s and which he used to take hundreds of photos in the subsequent decades. I had a great deal of respect for that camera as most of my family photos were shot with it and in rare circumstances that my dad allowed me to shoot it as a kid, it proved virtually impossible to operate. For the past 10–15 years, however, it was collecting dust in my dad's apartment so it was high time to revitalize it.</p>

	</div>
	</figure><p class="">Finding unexpired film to shoot on also proved easier than I thought. I've located a lab that sells a number of different Fujifilm films (and some other brands, too) so I picked up a Superia 200 and was ready to go. Now, the idea of this post is not to describe <b>what</b> I was photographing but rather <b>how</b> I was photographing, what the experience was like, and what issues I ran into. After all, the primary objective was to get a good feel for the camera, experiment a little and mostly have fun, so the photos were not meant to be spectacular.</p><p class="">As I'm a fan of lists, let's turn this into a list summarizing my experience:</p><ol><li><b>Inserting the film into the camera</b> – I've never done this myself (yet) so fortunately my father did it for me as I would have probably screwed it big time. I know this is not super difficult but I did manage to screw up taking it out so ...</li><li><b>Winding the film</b> – since I hadn't shot an SLR before, the concept of winding the film before/after every single shot was largely unfamiliar to me; obviously it wasn't a problem but I would always forget about it and only did it when I realized I can't press the shutter.</li><li><b>Exposure counter dial</b> – my god, is this the stupidest thing ever! If you happen to not know what it is, it's that dial on the top plate telling you how many shots you've taken. The idea is perfectly fine if not for the fact that it moves so lightly that you will probably mess up your counter just by touching the dial. I did it at least a couple of times just taking it out of the bag so I never had any idea exactly how many photos I'd taken.</li><li><b>Viewfinder</b> – the viewfinder gave me the biggest headache for a number of reasons:</li><span style="background–color: transparent;"><ul><li>Its front element is so small that you can't see the entire frame – you need to move your eye around to see the borders. This wouldn't be a problem if I didn't wear glasses but I do. And I've never had this issues with any other camera I've tried despite the glasses.</li><li>While on faster apertures it's not so bad to look through, when you stop down you see pretty much next to nothing. Really. I get that the aperture blades actually close down in real time when you use the aperture ring but at the same time it makes it impossible to compose and/or focus on apertures of about f5.6 and slower, especially indoors. You need to do that on f2 and then stop down trying not to move the camera. But you're screwed either way because the exposure indicator also becomes invisible so what you're left with is an educated guess.</li><li>The viewfinder doesn't cover the entire scene. And it leaves out quite a large margin, too, judging by the developed photos. My dad warned me about it (he still has this nasty habit of cutting the top of people's heads when shooting with my Pentax) but it's really difficult to realistically assess how much the camera actually covers without using it for a prolonged period of time.</li><li>Focusing – it's a bitch. And I didn't realize how much until I saw the developed photos. I obviously thought I nailed it every single time but ... well, not even close. It's something that baffles me because I've shot with the Helios on my Pentax, and the Pentax offers no aid whatsoever while focusing manually (unlike Zenit) but my photos taken with the Helios attached to the Pentax never looked so out of focus. I know that I was shooting mainly wide open on the Zenit (for reasons stated above) and I'm also aware that the Zenit is a 35mm camera and the Pentax has an APS–C sensor so the depth of field is different, but still...<br><span style="background-color: transparent;">(However, I need to make a confession at this point – I've taken another look at the photos and they're not so bad in terms of focus, after all. Still, they're just 15x10cm prints so it's difficult to compare them to digital files.)</span></li></ul></span><li><b>Extracting the film from the camera</b> – boy, oh boy... I'd never done this before, wasn't exactly sure how to do it, and this time my father wasn't around to help me with it, so I did what most people would've probably done in my situation – I consulted the one and only source of all information, the highest oracle – THE INTERNET. And THE INTERNET told me a handful of useful things but it forgot to tell me that there was a little thing right beneath the shutter that I was supposed to push down when rolling the film. Since I didn't do it, the film didn't want to just civilly roll back to the container by itself, and so I had to use  some force on him. So much, in fact, that I tore it (as I later found out) but I didn't know that at the moment. But I did become suspicious after a longer period of unsuccessful winding of the crank so I opened up the camera to see if I'm making any progress – and not only did I find the film still fully loaded, but I also realized that I exposed it and probably ruined it...</li></ol><p class="">I took the camera to the lab to seek help. Fortunately, they were able to extract the film in an unscathed form but the real question was whether it was entirely exposed or not. I had to wait for a day for the lab to develop the film, so in the meantime, once again, I decided to consult THE INTERNET so see if it has any information on the possible condition of my undeveloped images. I found a Yahoo thread with a description of an issue similar to mine in which almost everybody condemned that poor guy's film to hell. It didn't make me optimistic but it turned out my concern was premature as most frames came out OK –but I did lose most photos taken with my girlfriend which was a big bummer.</p>

	</figure><p class="">This pretty much sums up my experience of shooting film for the first time on an SLR. I do realize I've mostly described the negative and/or problematic side of things so to counter that I need to say this – I had a blast. Shooting film was extremely fun and also liberating in a strange way. It's a very satisfying experience. Like a said at the very beginning of this post – it's a thrill, it adds the unknown back the entire process. I wish the Zenit was easier to operate but it also adds to the challenge which in itself is something worth giving a try. And even if you're not up to the challenge, remember that this camera turns you into a sexy looking retro nerd-beast when it's hanging down your neck ;)</p>
